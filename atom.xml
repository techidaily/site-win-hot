Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134237/18498" target="_top" id="2134237">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134237" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134237/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

Wow. That’s a lot of trashed PCs.</p><p>It might even be worse than that.

Many older Windows 10 machines lack the CPU or the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) needed for Windows 11. The TPM isn’t usually a problem, but if you have a PC from 2019 or earlier, the CPU will likely be unsupported.</p><p>Or, say you’ve looked at Windows 11 and said, “No, just no!” (That’s been my reaction.) Or you’ve considered forthcoming Windows 11 features such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-microsoft-recall-a-privacy-nightmare-7-reasons-you-can-stop-worrying-about-it/#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-microsoft-recall-a-privacy-nightmare-7-reasons-you-can-stop-worrying-about-it/%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22Microsoft%20Recall%22%7D" >Microsoft Recall <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and did not like it. What’s a user to do when their Windows machine can’t make the grade – or they simply don’t <em>want</em> to upgrade? </p><p>Well, here’s one choice you shouldn’t make: Do not keep running Windows 10 come the fall of 2025. Your machine will be hacked. There’s no ifs, ands, or buts about it. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/seven-ways-to-make-windows-11-less-annoying/" >7 ways to make Windows 11 less annoying <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Microsoft and its hardware friends want you to buy a new PC. Suppose, however, that you don’t want to buy a new computer. They’re not cheap, after all.

These offer better performance, more storage, and higher-quality displays, but they also cost north of $1,000. </p><p>So, what can you do? Here are better and cheaper options: </p><h2 id="1-Force-Windows-11-on-your-Windows-10-PC"><a href="#1-Force-Windows-11-on-your-Windows-10-PC" class="headerlink" title="1.

Force Windows 11 on your Windows 10 PC</strong></h2><p>You could gird your loins and hack your way to installing Windows 11 on your PC, even though, officially, Microsoft won’t support you if you try this trick. It’s a bit complicated <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/can-i-install-windows-11-on-my-pc-even-if-microsoft-says-its-incompatible-ask-zdnet/#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/can-i-install-windows-11-on-my-pc-even-if-microsoft-says-its-incompatible-ask-zdnet/%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22upgrading%20an%20unsupported%20Windows%2010%20PC%20to%20Windows%2011%22%7D" >upgrading an unsupported Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, as ZDNET’s resident Windows expert Ed Bott explains, but it’s not that hard either.</p><p>There’s also an open-source program, <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >Rufus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, that makes it easy to bypass the Windows 11 system check. This bootable USB drive creation program allows you to skip Windows 11 system requirements when you try to do an in-place upgrade.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Keep in mind, though, that Windows 11 might not work well or at all on your older PC.

Yes, I know you’ve been told that Linux is hard to use and install. It’s not. </p><p>Sure, back in the 2000s, you needed to be a Linux shell command wizard to install it and run its software.

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105864/7443" target="_top" id="2105864">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105864" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105864/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation. That’s why Microsoft has offered paid options to extend support for Windows 10 by three years. Customers in enterprise and education deployments are likely to take advantage of those options.</p><p>Consumers, though, will apparently be on their own.</p><p><em>This article was originally published in July 2023.

Like <a class="link"   href="https://genius.com/Monty-python-dead-parrot-sketch-annotated" >Monty Python’s Norwegian Blue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it will be pushing up the daisies. It will have shuffled off its mortal coil, run down the curtain, and joined the bleedin’ choir invisible!</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How is this even possible? It feels like only yesterday, but in fact, Windows 10 was officially released to the public more than nine years ago, in July 2015. Following on the heels of the ill-fated Windows 8, it became an unqualified success among consumers and business customers alike.</p><p>That’s good news, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>Microsoft has a big challenge on its hands in the runup to that end-of-support date: convincing its enormous installed base to leave their beloved Windows 10 behind and make the move to its successor operating system, Windows 11.</p><p>I wrote the original version of this post in July 2023. Now, as that end date draws uncomfortably closer, I decided to revisit the topic and answer some burning questions.</p><h2 id="When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users"><a href="#When-does-Windows-10-support-end-and-what-does-that-mean-for-Windows-10-users" class="headerlink" title="When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?"></a>When does Windows 10 support end, and what does that mean for Windows 10 users?</h2><p>Like every version of Windows in the modern era, Windows 10 adheres to a 10-year support lifecycle. That means that most Windows 10 editions – Home, Pro, Pro Workstation, Enterprise, and Education – reach their end-of support date on October 14, 2025. (For the nerdy details on how that date is calculated, see <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-will-microsoft-pull-the-plug-on-your-version-of-windows-or-office/" >“When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office?” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>So, what happens when that day arrives? Nothing. Seriously, absolutely nothing happens on that date. PCs running Windows 10 continue to work just as they always have, and they will do so indefinitely. </p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >Still have a Windows 10 PC? You have 5 options before support ends next year <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>From that date forward, however, those PCs will no longer receive security fixes through Windows Update unless their owners <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-keep-getting-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-what-it-will-cost/" >pay Microsoft for an Extended Security Updates (ESU) subscription <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On Windows 10 PCs without an ESU subscription, however, any security flaws found from that day forward will remain unpatched, making those PCs increasingly vulnerable to online attacks.</p><p>There is at least one exception to this cutoff date, which applies to PCs running Windows 10 Enterprise Long Term Servicing editions. In all, Microsoft has released four of these editions. The 2015 Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) ends support on October 14, 2025, along with the editions described earlier. The 2016 LTSB release ends support a year later, on October 13, 2026. Beginning in 2019, the name changed to Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC). For Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019, the end date is January 9, 2029. </p><p>Confusingly, Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 has only a five-year support lifecycle, which means it ends support on January 12, 2027.</p><h2 id="How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today"><a href="#How-many-PCs-are-running-Windows-10-today" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?"></a>How many PCs are running Windows 10 today?</h2><p>If anyone tells you they know the answer to this one, maybe stop listening to them?</p><p>Microsoft can probably make a solid estimate based on its telemetry, but the rest of us are forced to guess based on fragmentary third-party metrics.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-windows-11-the-way-you-want-and-sneak-by-microsofts-restrictions/" >How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and sneak by Microsoft’s restrictions) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>One of the sources I have relied on over the years is the United States Government’s <a class="link"   href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" >Digital Analytics Program (DAP) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which has a well-organized repository of information about traffic to official websites run by agencies like the Postal Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Service, the IRS, and NASA.</p><p>When I visited DAP last week, I retrieved data for the 30 days ending August 31, 2024, summarizing more than 1.6 billion visits to those websites from people using computers and mobile devices from all around the world. Here’s what the data told me about the visits from PCs and Macs:</p><p>Windows 11 is still having trouble overtaking Windows 10. Microsoft’s compatibility requirements aren’t helping. </p><p>DAP&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That’s an improvement over the numbers I found last year, which were unable to distinguish between visits from Windows 10 and Windows 11. One bit of good news is that other versions of Windows represent a trivial share of visits, being outnumbered by every alternative desktop platform, including <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-things-chrome-os-needs-to-rival-macos/" >ChromeOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>But if you extrapolate those numbers to the worldwide population of Windows PCs, you can see the problem. According to those numbers, roughly 60% of Windows PCs are still running Windows 10, which adds up to more than 700 million PCs that will be running an outdated, unsupported operating system a year from now. Yikes.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-debloating-windows-is-a-bad-idea-and-what-to-do-instead/" >Why ‘debloating’ Windows is a bad idea (and what to do instead) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>For people who are concerned about the security of the internet at large, that thought is … well, let’s call it <em>unnerving</em>.</p><p>Another widely used measure of web traffic, StatCounter, offers its own estimates of traffic from PCs running Microsoft Windows. Here’s its graph of <a class="link"   href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-version-market-share/windows/desktop/worldwide" >web traffic from Windows PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in their network over the past year.</p><p>The top line is Windows 10. The slowly climbing line far below it is Windows 11.</p><p>Stat Counter&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>That purple line at the top of the chart is Windows 10, and the blue line far below it is Windows 11. Now, I have my issues with StatCounter’s metrics, a topic <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/net-market-share-vs-statcounter-whose-online-measurements-can-you-trust/" >I have not been shy about discussing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> over the years. But I think the broad strokes of this data are probably accurate. </p><p>The current installed base of Windows PCs consists of about twice as many PCs running Windows 10 compared to its successor. (That’s an improvement over last year’s number, at least, where the ratio was more than three to one.)</p><h2 id="How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025"><a href="#How-many-PCs-will-still-be-running-Windows-10-at-the-end-of-2025" class="headerlink" title="How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?"></a>How many PCs will still be running Windows 10 at the end of 2025?</h2><p>That’s the real question, isn’t it?</p><p>Despite predictions of the imminent demise of the PC market, OEMs continue to sell more than 200 million new Windows computers each year. The most optimistic scenario is that every one of those new PCs sold in the next year replaces a Windows 10 device that is then retired, with another 100 million or so older PCs replaced by Chromebooks, iPads, and Macs. Maybe some old PCs are simply put out to pasture and not replaced at all, as consumers decide to use their phones or tablets instead.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-computer/"><strong>The best computers: Comparing laptops, Macs, PCs and more</strong></a></p><p>That best-case scenario still leaves hundreds of millions of people running Windows 10 when the October 2025 end-of-support date rolls around. Who owns those PCs?</p><ul><li><strong>Those who don’t qualify for an automatic upgrade.</strong> Some people own older hardware that doesn’t meet the minimum hardware compatibility standards for Windows 11. Basically, that means any PC that was designed in 2018 or earlier. Note that this category includes many budget PCs that used older designs and unsupported CPUs but were sold as new in 2019 and 2020.</li><li><strong>Corporate PCs that are standardized on Windows 10.</strong> A nontrivial number of enterprise IT managers have just finished their Windows 10 migrations in the last year or two and probably aren’t anxious to do it again.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 diehards.</strong> From my time spent reading support forums, I know there’s a large population of longtime Windows users who are unhappy about the changes in Windows 11. Some of them will reluctantly upgrade, but others won’t.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135373/19272" target="_top" id="2135373">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135373" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135373/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Will-Microsoft-extend-the-support-deadline-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?"></a>Will Microsoft extend the support deadline for Windows 10?</h2><p>That’s certainly a possibility, and there’s precedent for it in the experience of Windows XP, which ended support in April 2014, more than 12 years after it was first released. Windows XP users even received emergency security updates well after that official end date, to address the <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-wannacry-ransomware-is-still-a-threat-to-your-pc/" >WannaCry vulnerability <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in 2017 and a similar flaw in 2019. Likewise, Microsoft <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/install-immediately-microsoft-delivers-emergency-patch-for-printnightmare-security-bug/" >issued emergency security updates for Windows 7 in 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> after its support had officially ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-windows-11-setup-which-user-account-type-should-you-choose-how-to-decide/" >For Windows 11 setup, which user account type should you choose? How to decide <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>But it’s more likely that Microsoft will tell Windows 10 holdouts to pay for Extended Security Updates rather than giving them away for free.</p><p>Of course, in both cases, the customers running the soon-to-be-obsolete Windows version had the option to upgrade to a new version. Indeed, that’s the recommendation from Microsoft’s <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/overview/product-end-of-support-overview" >official Product End of Support page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Once a product reaches the end of support, or a service retires, there will be no new security updates, non-security updates, or assisted support. Customers are encouraged to migrate to the latest version of the product or service.</p></blockquote><p>For Windows 10, though, that alternative might not be available. Devices that don’t meet the hardware compatibility requirements will have no Microsoft-supported migration path to a newer version. As I pointed out <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/still-have-a-windows-10-pc-you-have-5-options-before-support-ends-next-year/" >the last time I looked at this issue <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the owners of those perfectly functional PCs, some only five or six years old, will instead have the following options:</p><ul><li><strong>Install a non-Microsoft operating system.</strong> Maybe 2026 will be the year when desktop <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-reasons-why-linux-will-eventually-overtake-windows-and-macos-on-the-desktop/" >Linux finally takes hold <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, although that’s unlikely. <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/installing-chromeos-flex-5-things-you-need-to-do-first-to-avoid-headaches/" >ChromeOS Flex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be another option, but it has its own <a class="link"   href="https://support.google.com/chromeosflex/answer/11513094?sjid=1307842147959197296-NA#zippy=,apple,microsoft" >hardware compatibility requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that probably make it unsuitable for older hardware.</li><li><strong>Ignore Microsoft’s warnings and upgrade to Windows 11 anyway.</strong> There are options to <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >install Windows 11 on “incompatible” hardware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but they require a fair amount of technical experience. People who are clinging to old PCs because they can’t afford a new one likely don’t have those specialized skills and may not even realize that the option is available. I doubt that many businesses would be willing to risk the support issues that come with that approach.</li><li><strong>Keep running Windows 10 and hope for the best.</strong> History suggests that this is the most likely option.</li></ul><p>Microsoft and its OEM partners would prefer that the owners of those devices dump them in a landfill and buy a new PC running Windows 11. However, my experience with PC owners, especially older people on a fixed income, is that they will use those devices until they stop working. Those PCs will be sitting ducks for a cyberattack like <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry-ransomware-crisis-one-year-on-are-we-ready-for-the-next-global-cyber-attack/" >WannaCry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which was brutally effective against the large population of Windows 7 PCs that were still in use three years after its support ended.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-secret-windows-11-setting-lets-you-kill-unresponsive-apps-much-faster/" >This secret Windows 11 setting lets you kill unresponsive apps much faster <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>That incident was a PR nightmare for Microsoft, and a repeat would be even more devastating to the company’s reputation.

Consumer pricing remains unclear.</p><p><strong>For Businesses:</strong></p><ul><li>Year 1: $61 per device</li><li>Year 2: $122 per device (doubles from Year 1)</li><li>Year 3: $244 per device (doubles from Year 2)</li></ul><p>The pricing is based on the traditional “5-by-5” activation key method. Microsoft is offering a 25% discount for organizations using Microsoft’s cloud-based update management solutions like Intune or Windows Autopatch, bringing the Year 1 cost down to $45 per user for up to five devices.</p><p><strong>For</strong> <a href="https://educationblog.microsoft.com/en-us/2024/04/windows-10-end-of-support-updates-for-education#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://educationblog.microsoft.com/en-us/2024/04/windows-10-end-of-support-updates-for-education%22,%22target%22:%22%5Fblank%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22%3Cstrong%3EEducation%20Customers%3C/strong%3E%22%7D"><strong>Education Customers</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p><ul><li>Year 1: $1 per license</li><li>Year 2: $2 per license</li><li>Year 3: $4 per license</li></ul><p><strong>For Windows 365 Customers:</strong></p><p>Extended Security Updates will be included at no additional cost for Windows 10 devices accessing Windows 365 Cloud PCs.</p><p>Keep in mind that the price for the Windows 10 ESU program doubles every year for a maximum of three years. Microsoft really, <em>really</em> doesn’t want you to stay on Windows 10. As the company says, <a class="link"   href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/when-to-use-windows-10-extended-security-updates/ba-p/4102628" >“Extended Security Updates are not intended to be a long-term solution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> but rather a temporary bridge.”</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/these-two-linux-desktops-are-the-simplest-picks-for-new-users/#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.zdnet.com/article/these-two-linux-desktops-are-the-simplest-picks-for-new-users/%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22%3Cstrong%3EThese%20two%20Linux%20desktops%20are%20the%20simplest%20picks%20for%20new%20users%3C/strong%3E%22%7D"><strong>These two Linux desktops are the simplest picks for new users</strong></a></p><p>In addition, the ESUs provide only security updates. There will be no new features or non-security patches. If you run into trouble, technical support will be limited and require an active support plan.</p><p>In summary, commercial organizations will pay $61 to $244 per device over three years, while education gets heavily discounted pricing of $1 to $4 per license. Consumer pricing is still to be determined.</p><p>I’d only go with an ESU, myself, if I <em>really</em> had no other choice.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1328683">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328683.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1328683">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328683.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1328683%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1328683/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Try-alternative-security-patching"><a href="#5-Try-alternative-security-patching" class="headerlink" title="5.

We’ve all heard that inactivity can negatively affect overall health. Regular exercise can help improve mental well-being, strengthen the immune system, build muscle, and support healthy bones. </p><h3 id="ZDNET-Recommends"><a href="#ZDNET-Recommends" class="headerlink" title="ZDNET Recommends"></a><strong>ZDNET</strong> Recommends</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-fitness-tracker/" >The best fitness trackers Fitness trackers offer a reasonably-priced alternative to smartwatches.  Read now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>And yet, it can be hard to get dressed and commute to the gym, especially after a long day of work – but desk bikes are an excellent solution. Instead of remaining stationary for hours on end, you can pedal under your desk while you work on that project or draft a promotion-worthy email – all while staying in place. </p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-treadmill-desk/"><strong>What are the best treadmill desks and do they really work?</strong></a></p><p>Cycling is a low-impact form of cardio that can be easier on the joints compared to running. You don’t have to train for a triathlon, but cycling a few miles can be a great habit that you won’t immediately grow sick of. Plus, it’s best to set attainable goals and accomplish small wins throughout your day. A bike desk allows you to habit stack your work and fitness by combining cardio with productivity.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-fitness-app/"><strong>These fitness apps have the best online home workout programs</strong></a></p><p>It’s not just remote workers who are moving to bike desks.

You can easily adjust the bike seat up or down by pressing the pneumatic adjustment lever – no pins or knobs. The entire bike desk comes shipped to you in five pieces, which makes setting up a breeze. </p><p>The desk measures 20 by 20 inches, so it can easily fit a laptop and notebook, and it’s ergonomically designed to provide a comfortable work experience. You can adjust the desk height with a lever and move the entire machine from location to location quickly on easy-move rollers. The pedals are easy to access and marketed as silent, so you won’t be distracted by squeaky gears.</p><p>Overall, the FlexiSpot Deskcise Pro is an elegant bike desk with a scratch-resistant exterior and user-friendly design. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0762FFNQ4?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C853c39df-5feb-4cd5-9216-5088f4775f49%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Exerpeutic-ExerWorK-Adjustable-Folding-Exercise/dp/B01F8W8PK6?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C853c39df-5feb-4cd5-9216-5088f4775f49%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Exerpeutic Exerwork 1000 Best bike desk with pulse sensors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p>Amazon</p><p>Pros &amp; Cons </p><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Drawer and cupholder built into desk</li><li>Foldable</li><li>Bluetooth option</li><li>Heart rate monitor</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Small desk surface</li><li>Heavy</li></ul><p>More Details </p><p><strong>Tech specs:</strong> <strong>Weight capacity:</strong> 300 pounds | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 45.3 x 25 x 51.3 inches | <strong>Item weight:</strong> 71 oounds | <strong>Height range:</strong> 5 to 6 feet | <strong>Number of resistance levels:</strong> 8</p><p>The Exerpeutic Exerwork 1000 features a sliding desk that can move forward, back, up, and down, as well as tilt at 0, 16, and 33 degrees. The desk measures 24 by 16 inches, and it’s an excellent bike desk for apartments, because it can be folded and stored in approximately 2 square feet. </p><p>The entire bike desk weighs 71 pounds, but there are built-in wheels to help you move it. Plus, the added weight makes the machine feel more stable while you cycle.The great thing about the Exerwork is that it has pulse sensors to monitor your heart rate throughout your workout. (Ever wondered if your pulse spikes when you get an email from your boss? Now’s the time to find out!) </p><p>The heart rate monitor ensures you work out safely, and you can track your workouts on the MyCloudFitness app if you upgrade to the Bluetooth-capable version. </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Exerpeutic-ExerWorK-Adjustable-Folding-Exercise/dp/B01F8W8PK6?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C853c39df-5feb-4cd5-9216-5088f4775f49%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Exerpeutic-Overwork-1000-Fully-Adjustable-Desk-Folding-Exercise-Bike-with-Pulse/51872341&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https://www.target.com/p/exerpeutic-workfit-1000-desk-station-folding-exercise-bike-with-pulse/-/A-51851692&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1" >View now at Target <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p>more buying choices </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Fit-Right-Resistance-Workstation-Stationary/dp/B086B8T913?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C853c39df-5feb-4cd5-9216-5088f4775f49%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Fit Right Bike Desk Best cheap bike desk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p>Amazon</p><p>Pros &amp; Cons </p><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Leather seat</li><li>Adjustable seat and desk height</li><li>Silent</li><li>Foldable</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>No pedal straps</li><li>Desk cannot be extended</li><li>No back support</li></ul><p>More Details </p><p><strong>Tech specs:</strong> <strong>Weight capacity:</strong> 285 pounds | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 30 x 20 x 50 inches | <strong>Item weight:</strong> 51 pounds | <strong>Height range:</strong> 5 to 6.5 feet | <strong>Number of resistance levels:</strong> 8</p><p>The Fit Right bike desk is similar to FlexiSpot, but priced at $200 less. The foldable bike desk has a stable base with transportation wheels, so you can easily store it. Once folded, it only takes up 30 by 7 inches, and it comes partially assembled in the box, so setup is as hassle-free as possible. </p><p>The desk has a cupholder and enough space for a small laptop. If you have a larger machine or need more space, the desk may be too small for you. Both the desk and the seat are adjustable with a range of approximately 10 inches each. </p><p>The LCD monitor tracks it all, so you can measure your biking performance over time and in terms of speed, distance, and calories burned. The leather seat allows you to work and workout comfortably, and a silent gear belt ensures you won’t get distracted.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Fit-Right-Resistance-Workstation-Stationary/dp/B086B8T913?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7C853c39df-5feb-4cd5-9216-5088f4775f49%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >View now at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><a class="link"   href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedId=zdnet&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/8-Level-Magnetic-Resistance-Exercise-Bike-Desk-Office-Desk-Workstation-W-Adjustable-Leather-Seat-Bikes-With-Build-In-LCD-Monitor-Home-Exerwork-Max-28/765453159&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >View now at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p>more buying choices </p><p><a class="link"   href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/568844/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/55639224&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp" >FitDesk Bike 3.0 Best full body workout bike desk <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> </p><p>Amazon</p><p>Pros &amp; Cons </p><p><strong>Pros</strong> </p><ul><li>Built-in storage tray</li><li>Massage bar for arm support</li><li>Resistance bands included</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong> </p><ul><li>Small desk area</li><li>No foot straps</li><li>Assembly required</li></ul><p>More Details </p><p><strong>Tech specs:</strong> <strong>Weight capacity:</strong> 300 pounds | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 28 x 16 x 45 inches | <strong>Item weight:</strong> 45 pounds | <strong>Height range:</strong> 4.8 to 6.5 feet | <strong>Number of resistance levels:</strong> 8</p><p>The possibilities abound with a FitDesk 3.0. It has a massage bar built-in for your arms and comes with resistance bands so you can do an upper body workout while cycling. The machine is marketed as quiet and reliable, so you won’t be bothered by squeaky gears.

It allows you to read, watch a tutorial, or get some work done, with the option to be hands-free. The compact machine is relatively light and foldable, and it’s made of aluminum and steel instead of plastic. </p><p>The bike features eight resistance levels, so you can adjust your workout to suit your physical limitations and comfort.

I researched the best bikes and found some great options to help others incorporate activity seamlessly into their work schedule.</p><p>After hours of poring over specs and reviews, I found the top five bike desks so we can all prioritize activity and make sure professional success doesn’t come at the expense of physical health.

Factor in the app, onboard cameras that monitor plant health, and a great selection of grow pods and you have the makings of a garden to go.</p><p>We’ve had the Gardyn for about two months and our first harvest is upon us. How is it working out, and is this a long-term indoor gardening solution for us? Read on to find out.</p><h2 id="Specifications"><a href="#Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Specifications"></a>Specifications</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Size and weight</th><th>24”W x 12”D x 64”H &amp; 20 pounds shipped</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Lights</td><td>2x 60W LED lights 54kWh estimated energy use per month</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sensors</td><td>Measure water level, humidity and interior temperature</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cameras</td><td>2x 5MP inward-facing cameras</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Power</td><td>Line voltage | 110V – 240V Frequency</td><td>50-60Hz grounded outlet, 24VDC, 7.5 AMP power supply</td></tr><tr><td>Materials</td><td>Columns and UV-stabilized, recyclable, BPA-free yCubes made of corn-based compostable plastic</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Wi-Fi</td><td>Requires 2.4GHz band* 802.11n wireless network. *Not compatible with 5GHz</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>$899</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h2 id="Setting-up-the-Gardyn"><a href="#Setting-up-the-Gardyn" class="headerlink" title="Setting up the Gardyn"></a>Setting up the Gardyn</h2><p>Okay, this was a little trickier than I bargained for. The Gardyn 3.0, which adds durability and evolving AI capabilities since the 2.0 release, takes up a relatively small footprint but, dimensionally, is quite large, standing 64” and encompassing three different growing towers. </p><p>Factor in the two vertical light elements, the large base, and various connecting bits and you’re talking about a big box and a lot of packaging. It took me 15 minutes to unpack the thing and I was left with a lot of cardboard. I was encouraged to not see a lot of plastic in the packaging, but I was still dismayed that I would need to use our wagon to cart the refuse up to the dumpster.</p><p>Setup takes some time. It’s Ikea-level involved – not hard but requires some time and attention. </p><p>Greg Nichols&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The setup itself isn’t complicated but it is involved. You’re basically assembling a piece of furniture, and while I’m now familiar with the Gardyn and its components after several tank cleans, it took me the better part of an hour to set up initially. In fairness I’m slow on the uptake with step-by-step instructions and the process suffered from the fact that I installed two of the towers incorrectly to start and then forgot to hook up one of the irrigation hoses to the pump, requiring multiple partial disassemblies. A more observant student of Ikea builds would have done better.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/kitchen-household/best-indoor-garden/" >Best smart indoor gardens (and what you can grow) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Pro tip: Set this thing up in the location where it’ll end up. I thought I was doing that, but once I had the Gardyn standing in front of me in its full glory, I realized it wasn’t going to work in our boat’s upstairs common area. Instead, it would be relegated to the engine room downstairs, where it would freshen the air even as our big Caterpillar diesel churned away.</p><h2 id="How-its-technology-works"><a href="#How-its-technology-works" class="headerlink" title="How its technology works"></a>How its technology works</h2><p>Gardyn employs what it calls Hybriponic technology, a riff on “Hydroponic,” which is the generic term for growing plants in water without the use of soil.</p><p>The term is marketing buzz but the system it seeks to describe is pretty cool. The vertical garden is a mostly autonomous workhorse that grows a surprising density of plants. Where systems from many competitors start with a vertical garden housing designed for outdoor use and retrofit lights, Gardyn is designed from the ground up for indoor use.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-home/best-smart-light/" >The best smart lights money can buy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The integrated LED lights are shockingly bright when they blink on for the first time, and the light is directed at the plants in various zones that correlate to full sun or degrees of indirect sunlight. A water pump moves water from the base up dedicated irrigation tubes inside the towers, where each pod is watered according to a programmed schedule. As the plants grow, the roots are held in the contained “yPods,” making harvesting easy. </p><p>We’re keeping our Gardyn 3.0 in the engine room. It makes for quite a contrast, and it definitely brightens up the space.</p><p>Greg Nichols&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>The coolest feature is also the one that’s easiest to miss. The built-in cameras monitor plant growth and optimize the schedule based on your garden. The system can tell how fast your plants are growing and customize the light and watering cycle to suit your specific garden. This is vastly more powerful than simple timer-based devices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398455/3022" target="_top" id="398455">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398455" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398455/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="App-experience"><a href="#App-experience" class="headerlink" title="App experience"></a>App experience</h2><p>All communication with your Gardyn takes place via the app. Gardyn’s AI essentially tells you what to do via Kelby, the smart personal assistant.</p><p>Kelby sends push notifications to your phone to indicate when an action is needed. For example, once sprouts begin to grow, many plants need to be pruned to enable a single stalk to thrive. It’s also important to stay on top of water quantity and quality. A full tank change is necessary about once per month, with water added periodically between tank cleanings. </p><p><strong>Also</strong>: <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-plant-subscription/" >The 5 best plant subscription boxes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>The plants also require plant food once they’ve started to sprout. A sizable quantity of plant food comes with the system, enough for several harvests, but this is something that requires some vigilance.</p><p>The Kelby smart assistant does a great job keeping you updated with to-dos and tips.</p><p>Greg Nichols&#x2F;ZDNET</p><p>Kelby also gives you tips and tricks relevant to your plants. Personally, I could actually do with slightly fewer notifications, although now that my first big leafy green harvest is approaching, I’m finding myself more engaged with the garden day to day.</p><p>One cool feature is that you can view your plants in real-time in your app through the two cameras on the Gardyn. There’s a timelapse functionality in the app as well, although mine has yet to populate and I get an error message when I click on it. I’m not sure if that’s because my plants are still growing or the functionality remains in development.</p><p>The app’s plant book allows for some great discoverability. I wasn’t familiar with borage, for example, but look forward to growing the edible flower. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115937/19272" target="_top" id="2115937">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115937" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115937/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="A-quibble"><a href="#A-quibble" class="headerlink" title="A quibble"></a>A quibble</h2><p>Overall I’m really impressed with the Gardyn Home Kit 3.0 and plan to use it onboard Lindy for years to come. But I do have some notes.</p><p>The first is related to the clunky setup process. Because the Gardyn requires such routine tank cleaning, it needs to be partially disassembled fairly regularly. I have done this multiple times but have yet to figure out an elegant way to do it. The tower portion of the Gardyn comes off easily enough via two locking latches on the base, but to get to the tank, you have to lift the entire tower structure up and put it down, dripping wet, on a nearby towel, leaning it against a wall to stay upright. I have mine anchored to the wall via the included strap, which means unscrewing it from the wall before I execute this maneuver.</p><p>Lining up the tower as it’s lifted back onto the base after cleaning has consistently required multiple attempts. Meanwhile, the whole garden is wobbling and I feel an impending sense that some part or another is going to break. It’s not that the materials are cheap feeling – they aren’t – but rather that the system wasn’t built with ergonomics and handling in mind. If this were a static piece of furniture, that would be fine – a refrigerator isn’t built to be lifted routinely either and no one complains about that. But we’re talking about a process that needs to be performed every month, and it feels like it should be easier.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJS4YMNQ?linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ccbc986cb-8e15-439f-9af8-b09f6df18aed%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Gardyn Home Kit 3.0 $695 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Bottom-line"><a href="#Bottom-line" class="headerlink" title="Bottom line"></a>Bottom line</h2><p>At the end of the day, I’m very impressed with the <a class="link"   href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR_URL=https://www.amazon.com/Generation-Hydroponics-Vertical-Vegetables-Gardening/dp/B0BJS4YMNQ?tag=zd-buy-button-20&ascsubtag=__COM_CLICK_ID__%7Ccbc986cb-8e15-439f-9af8-b09f6df18aed%7Cdtp&dtb=1" >Gardyn Home Kit 3.0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and I’m happy to have it as a centerpiece feature of our home, which happens to be a boat. </p><p>Despite my quibbles above, this ranks as an impressive and <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/kitchen-household/best-indoor-garden/" >powerful home-growing system <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a wide variety of vegetables.

It didn’t go well <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p>I received an email, you see, from the company, with a hearty New Year’s twist. The subject line was, “Try one of these creative ways to use Microsoft Excel this year.” </p><p>I confess I’d never thought I’d see a sentence that included the words “Excel” and “creative,” unless that sentence was, “If you’re just not creative at all, you might actually enjoy using Excel.” </p><p>Yet here is Microsoft with six suggestions that may inspire you to greater heights or merely drift your mind to a wintery woe.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/how-to-create-a-drop-down-list-in-excel/"><strong>How to create a drop-down list in Excel</strong></a></p><p>Firstly, Microsoft would like you to use Excel to track your fitness. </p><p>Don’t desperate fitness people already have fancy watches and apps to do just that? Don’t they adore sharing their performance data with their fitness trainers, significant friends, or just every other fitness obsessive in the world? </p><p>The mere idea of Excel somehow dramatizing or even enlightening one’s fitness numbers seems quaint.</p><p>If that doesn’t grab you either, how about using Excel to play Sudoku? I always thought people used Sudoku to play Sudoku, and there’s surely nothing playful about Excel. How would Excel enhance the Sudoku experience? I have no clue.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-fitness-tracker/"><strong>The 5 best fitness trackers</strong></a> </p><p>Microsoft’s third suggestion is equally sedentary: Follow your sports bracket.</p><p>Oh, I suppose. </p><p>I think Microsoft is specifically referring to the NCAA Tournament, without actually naming it for legal reasons. Again, though, Excel for that? Aren’t there a hundred prettier little apps that give your bracket a more glorious look? Or am I simply not giving Excel sufficient credit?</p><p>Microsoft is undeterred. If you don’t want to use Excel for your sports bracket, how about using it to plan your vacation? I actually clicked on that link from the email and found, oh, the Trip Planner with the word “worksheet” in parentheses. </p><p>I don’t want planning my trips to be work. I want them to be fun. And the templates Microsoft offers here look anything other than a day at the beach.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-trip-planner-app/"><strong>The 5 best trip planner apps</strong></a></p><p>Was Microsoft getting desperate here? I fear it’s possible. Especially as its next idea was “Create Pixel Art.” </p><p>I have no idea what this has to do with Excel as, when I clicked on the link, it took me to <a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/@microsoft365/video/7017812421733633285?ocid=cmm50bixyyq" >a TikTok <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of illustrations from circa 1978. One was of a waffle, I’m told, because waffles have rows and columns. </p><p>This wasn’t working on me. It just wasn’t. It wasn’t working on everyone on the TikTok page either, as there were comments, such as “Can’t open Microsoft Edge help” and “How do I get the TPM 2.0 Stick for Windows 11?”</p><p>I was feeling spent. None of these creative Excel activities felt appealing. None of them screamed at me to change my less than Excel-lent ways.</p><p>But there was one more suggestion to go. This would surely be the most creative of all. You have the leave the best for the end, surely.</p><p>Well, suggestion No. 6 was: “Organize Your Week. Stay on top of your to do list and make time for what’s important.”</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/best-to-do-list-app/"><strong>The 6 best to-do list apps</strong></a></p><p>Ah. Oh.</p><p>I felt Microsoft had run out of ideas. I know a lot of people use Excel for organization, so I struggled to see how this idea was in any way creative.</p><p>Please, it may well be there are many people around the world who are immensely adept at using Excel for all sorts of exciting things.

An option called God Mode eases the process by providing a gateway to all the core options on one screen.</p><p>By setting up the special God Mode folder, you can view the settings for Backup and Restore, Color Management, Devices and Printers, Ease of Access, File History, Mouse, Power Options, Programs and Features, Security and Maintenance, Speech Recognition, Troubleshooting, User Accounts, and much more.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-a-tpm-and-why-does-windows-11-require-one/" >What is a TPM, and why does Windows 11 require one? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>God Mode is especially useful for advanced Windows users and developers who like to manage and tweak all the nitty-gritty details of Windows. But it can also prove helpful to anyone who wants an array of commands available in one place. Since Microsoft no longer offers a Start menu shortcut for Control Panel, God Mode can be a quick and easy way to access all of its core features and applets.</p><p>The process for setting up God Mode is the same in Windows 10 and 11, but here, I’m focusing on Windows 11. Now, let’s see how this works.</p><h2 id="How-to-set-up-God-Mode-in-Windows-11"><a href="#How-to-set-up-God-Mode-in-Windows-11" class="headerlink" title="How to set up God Mode in Windows 11"></a>How to set up God Mode in Windows 11</h2><h2 id="1-Check-your-account"><a href="#1-Check-your-account" class="headerlink" title="1.

It didn’t go well <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><p>I received an email, you see, from the company, with a hearty New Year’s twist. The subject line was, “Try one of these creative ways to use Microsoft Excel this year.” </p><p>I confess I’d never thought I’d see a sentence that included the words “Excel” and “creative,” unless that sentence was, “If you’re just not creative at all, you might actually enjoy using Excel.” </p><p>Yet here is Microsoft with six suggestions that may inspire you to greater heights or merely drift your mind to a wintery woe.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/how-to-create-a-drop-down-list-in-excel/"><strong>How to create a drop-down list in Excel</strong></a></p><p>Firstly, Microsoft would like you to use Excel to track your fitness. </p><p>Don’t desperate fitness people already have fancy watches and apps to do just that? Don’t they adore sharing their performance data with their fitness trainers, significant friends, or just every other fitness obsessive in the world? </p><p>The mere idea of Excel somehow dramatizing or even enlightening one’s fitness numbers seems quaint.</p><p>If that doesn’t grab you either, how about using Excel to play Sudoku? I always thought people used Sudoku to play Sudoku, and there’s surely nothing playful about Excel. How would Excel enhance the Sudoku experience? I have no clue.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-fitness-tracker/"><strong>The 5 best fitness trackers</strong></a> </p><p>Microsoft’s third suggestion is equally sedentary: Follow your sports bracket.</p><p>Oh, I suppose. </p><p>I think Microsoft is specifically referring to the NCAA Tournament, without actually naming it for legal reasons. Again, though, Excel for that? Aren’t there a hundred prettier little apps that give your bracket a more glorious look? Or am I simply not giving Excel sufficient credit?</p><p>Microsoft is undeterred. If you don’t want to use Excel for your sports bracket, how about using it to plan your vacation? I actually clicked on that link from the email and found, oh, the Trip Planner with the word “worksheet” in parentheses. </p><p>I don’t want planning my trips to be work. I want them to be fun. And the templates Microsoft offers here look anything other than a day at the beach.</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-trip-planner-app/"><strong>The 5 best trip planner apps</strong></a></p><p>Was Microsoft getting desperate here? I fear it’s possible. Especially as its next idea was “Create Pixel Art.” </p><p>I have no idea what this has to do with Excel as, when I clicked on the link, it took me to <a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/@microsoft365/video/7017812421733633285?ocid=cmm50bixyyq" >a TikTok <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of illustrations from circa 1978. One was of a waffle, I’m told, because waffles have rows and columns. </p><p>This wasn’t working on me. It just wasn’t. It wasn’t working on everyone on the TikTok page either, as there were comments, such as “Can’t open Microsoft Edge help” and “How do I get the TPM 2.0 Stick for Windows 11?”</p><p>I was feeling spent. None of these creative Excel activities felt appealing. None of them screamed at me to change my less than Excel-lent ways.</p><p>But there was one more suggestion to go. This would surely be the most creative of all. You have the leave the best for the end, surely.</p><p>Well, suggestion No. 6 was: “Organize Your Week. Stay on top of your to do list and make time for what’s important.”</p><p><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/best-to-do-list-app/"><strong>The 6 best to-do list apps</strong></a></p><p>Ah. Oh.</p><p>I felt Microsoft had run out of ideas. I know a lot of people use Excel for organization, so I struggled to see how this idea was in any way creative.</p><p>Please, it may well be there are many people around the world who are immensely adept at using Excel for all sorts of exciting things. Why, Microsoft itself <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-just-watched-microsoft-try-to-make-excel-exciting-recovery-wont-be-easy/" >even holds an Excel championship <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for truly exciting people. Like actuaries, I think.</p><p>I fear, though, that for very many people, Excel is just a dull, efficient, utilitarian thing, and it will always be so – until <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/chatgpts-next-big-challenge-helping-microsoft-to-challenge-google-search/" >ChatGPT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> makes it

Then you could find yourself on the outs with Microsoft. </p><p>Windows 11 21H2 and 22H2 are no longer supported by the folks in Redmond. This means that anyone still running these versions won’t receive future bug fixes, security patches, or other updates. And that could place your computer at a greater risk for malware, security flaws, and other threats.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/yes-you-can-upgrade-that-old-pc-to-windows-11-even-if-microsoft-says-no-these-readers-proved-it/" >Yes, you can upgrade that old PC to Windows 11, even if Microsoft says no. These readers proved it <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>On Sunday, Microsoft revised its <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows11-release-information" >Windows 11 release information page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to indicate the retirement of the two older versions, listing both 21H2 and 22H2 as having reached the end of servicing for Windows 11 Home, Pro, Pro Education, and Pro for Workstations. Only the Enterprise and Education editions are spared; they’re still able to receive updates to Windows 11 22H2 until October 14 of 2025.</p><p>How do you know which version you’re running? That’s easy enough. Head to Settings, select System, and then click About. Scroll down to the section for Windows specifications to find the version. If Windows 11 23H2 is listed, then you’re fine. But what if you’re stuck with an older edition? In that case, you can update your PC yourself, or Microsoft will now do it for you.</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-is-going-to-start-charging-for-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-how-much/" >Microsoft is going to start charging for Windows 10 updates next year. Here’s how much <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>Go to Settings, select Windows Update, and click the button for “Check for Updates.” Microsoft will download and install the latest updates, which will include 23H2. If you don’t do this yourself and automatic updates are turned on, the update will automatically run as part of this month’s Patch Tuesday, rolled out on September 10.</p><p>Keeping track of Windows updates can be challenging and frustrating, especially with so many of them pushed out on a regular and irregular basis. Microsoft has tried to streamline the major updates by launching them annually and naming them with the year and period. But the names can be confusing since we’re almost in the final quarter of 2024 and Windows 11 is still stuck on a 2023 version. In the midst of this messiness, making sure your PC is fully protected against security hazards is the most critical task.</p><p>On its <a class="link"   href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows-message-center" >Windows Message Center page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Microsoft issued this warning:</p><p>**”**The October 2024 security update is the last security release for Enterprise and Education editions of Windows 11, version 21H2 and Home and Pro editions of Windows 11, version 22H2. After this date, devices running these editions will no longer receive monthly security and preview updates containing protections from the latest security threats.”</p><h4 id="Newsletters"><a href="#Newsletters" class="headerlink" title="Newsletters"></a>Newsletters</h4><p>ZDNET Tech Today</p><p>ZDNET’s Tech Today newsletter is a daily briefing of the newest, most talked about stories, five days a week.</p><p> Subscribe</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/newsletters/" >See all <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>In the following message, Microsoft explains that it will perform the update if you fail to do so:</p><p>“To help keep you protected and productive, Windows Update will automatically initiate a feature update for Windows 11 Home and Pro devices that are not managed by IT departments when these are nearing end of servicing. Moving to Windows 11, version 23H2 keeps your device supported and receiving monthly updates that are critical to security and ecosystem health.”</p><p><strong>Also: <a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11/" >How to upgrade your ‘incompatible’ Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p>How long will it be before Windows 11 23H2 is no longer supported? That depends on when 24H2 is released to the general public. Right now, this year’s major Windows 11 update is officially available only on <a class="link"   href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5043950-windows-11-version-24h2-support-2fd719b6-8c26-469f-99fe-832eb1b702d7" >Copilot PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/05/22/releasing-windows-11-version-24h2-to-the-release-preview-channel/" >through Release Preview builds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Let’s assume that 24H2 kicks off to everyone by the end of 2024. Then the current flavor of 23H2 should have at least another year of life left before Microsoft forces you to update again.</p><h4 id="Featured"><a href="#Featured" class="headerlink" title="Featured"></a>Featured</h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ai-features-iphone-users-can-expect-first-on-ios-18-and-whats-coming-later/"  title="6 AI features iPhone users can expect first on iOS 18 (and what&#39;s coming later)">6 AI features iPhone users can expect first on iOS 18 (and what’s coming later) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-your-windows-license-legal-should-you-even-care/"  title="Is your Windows license legal?

Remote workers are technically those who work at any location that is not the company’s central office and, in turn, are nowhere near other coworkers. Hybrid workers work half their time in a company’s main office and half remotely – a trend that has surged since the COVID-19 pandemic. </p><h2 id="What-should-I-keep-in-mind-when-working-remotely"><a href="#What-should-I-keep-in-mind-when-working-remotely" class="headerlink" title="What should I keep in mind when working remotely?"></a>What should I keep in mind when working remotely?</h2><p>While working remotely offers immense flexibility, you must be mindful of certain “side effects.” First and foremost, the lines between work and play can be blurred. If you want to succeed at a remote job, you must distinguish between your work and home setup. While this can be physical, such as a designated work space within your home or a specific work schedule, it can also be mental; this means creating boundaries of when and where you want to answer messages, send Slacks, or even log into your laptop. </p><p>Secondly, it is essential to keep in mind cybersecurity at all costs. While you may consider you are not at risk since you are in the comfort of your own home or paying attention to your laptop at all times within your local coffee shop, you may be compromising your company’s security.
