## **DEX 2.5 is here, and it’s our most complete video mixing software (VJ) for seamlessly mixing music videos mashups to date.**

**PCDJ DEX 2** has been our flagship **DJ software** application for the last 2 years. DEX 2 is essentially a culmination of over 13 years of DJ software development experiance wrapped up in one robust product. The goal from the start was to create one solution for DJ’s; **a product that mixes video as well as it does audio (and yes, even Karaoke).**

While PCDJ DEX 2 has been terrific for mixing audio easily, with key features such as BPM sync, realistic scratching, audio effects and looping – it was addmitantly lacking in the **video mixing** department…

**Enter DEX 2.5\.** 

Included in the new release are the first of many to come **video effects and video transitions**, they are as follows:

## **Video Effects:**

* Water: Think ripples and bubbles – utterly and organically awesome!
* ZoomBlur: Center zoom with blurred edges effect
* Invert: Inverts video colors
* Toon: Cartoon effect makes everything look a bit “Roger Rabbit”
* Tiles: Slices the video into square tile cutouts
* Red, Blue, and Green Filters: Change the entire color of the music video dynamically

## **Video Transitions:**

* Fade: Seamless blend of one video into another
* Cut: Quick cut from one video to another, great for scratching videos
* Slide H: Slide one video into another right to left or left to right
* Slide V: Slide a video top to bottom or bottom to top
* Wave: Water type effect makes it seem like one music video “crashes” into another
* Circle: Fade into a video “hole” effect

These are just the first video effects of many on our to-do list. I can say with great confidence that _**the quality of our video effects are umatched in the video mixing software marketing place**._ We are taking out time to get the video effects and transitions right. There may be other DJ software and VJ solutions on the market today that include a few more effects, but I think you’ll find the quality of our effects far surperior for **video mixing**.

The Windows version of PCDJ DEX 2.5 is available for demo download from [www.pcdj.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) today, with the MAC version of DEX 2.5 available in less than a week. I would highly suggest downloading a demo and taking it for a test spin. **I think you’ll enjoy the new video mixing capabilities emmencly!**

**_Now back to the bat cave…_**
