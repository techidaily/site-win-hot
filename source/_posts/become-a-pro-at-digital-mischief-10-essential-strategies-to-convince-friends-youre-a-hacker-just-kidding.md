## 1\. Type Secret Hacking Codes like Hackers

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/coding.png)

No, I am not asking you to learn to code. It is simple and one of the best tricks to prank your friends and fool them into thinking you have hacked someone’s computer. Just log in to www.hackertyper.com and press a few keys. Then press the Alt key twice.

A pop-up message stating “Access Granted” will be displayed on the screen. You only have to press a few keys to make sure friends believe in your “hacking capabilities.”

## 2\. Change the Command Prompt Color for the Whole Hacker Feel

Have you ever seen the hackers in movies? The ones wearing ski masks typing gibberish codes in green color? Yes, that’s precisely how your friends have seen it too.

Just changing the command prompt text color can help you here. Additionally, you can also change the background color and text transparency from command prompt settings.

For changing the color, run the command prompt and type

`color //?​`

Hit enter and select the number of Green colors. Alternately, you can also try other colors of your choice to pass off as a valid hacker in your group.

![Change the Command Prompt Color for the Whole Hacker Feel](https://www.malwarefox.com//www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/green-terminal-window.png)

## 3\. Trick Them with Chrome Passwords

![Trick Them with Chrome Passwords](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/password-2.png)

People are lazy, and that includes your friends. I am sure at least 90% of your friends have saved their passwords on chrome for a quicker log-in time. Now, you can use this to your advantage.

Just type **chrome://settings/passwords** in the URL tab and hit enter. From here, you can steal all your friends’ saved passwords and log in to their social media. This way will surely make them believe your story.

## 4\. Inspect Element to Reveal Passwords

Shock your friend by stealing their Facebook passwords. It’s quite simple.

As you know, passwords are hidden by default. If your friends have entered a password, just click on the password tab and right-click to Inspect Element. Now, change the text type from password to text. This action will reveal the hidden password, and you can make your friends think you did it with rigorous hacking.

This method is one of the best ways to look like a professional hacker using modern browsers including Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.

## 5\. Shutdown your Friend’s PC with your Custom Message

Here’s a brief code you can write on the notepad to shut down your friend’s PC without them knowing. Using this method, you can easily trick them into believing you have hacked their system.

Open the notepad and type the fun code:

`@echo off  
Shutdown.exe -s -t 10  
Cls  
msg * I told you not to mess with me!`

Now, save this file as **myvirus.bat**

Your first virus made in notepad is ready!

## 6\. Deploy Keylogger Software on your Friend’s Phone or PC

![Deploy Keylogger Software](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/login.png)

It is a reasonably simple way to look like a professional hacker in front of your friends. Take any of your friend’s phones or PC and download a keylogger software on them. A keylogger software essentially keeps a record of every keystroke and stores it in a log file.

Using this method, you can gain access to your friends’ passwords and show it to them later on.

## 7\. Fake Windows Data Transfer Progress Bar to Prank your Buddies

Download this [fake progress bar](https://www.digitalvolcano.co.uk/other.html), and you’re good to go. You can also customize the icons, buttons, speed, and progress bar message. Just tell your friends you have [hacked](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) into someone’s PC and show them the progress bar.

![Fake Progress Bar](https://www.malwarefox.com//www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/fake-progress-bar.png)

## 8\. Makeover your PC for the Look and Feel of a Hacker’s PC

Download Rainmeter and change the whole look of your PC. Rainmeter is one of the best Utility software for Windows PC that’ll give you the entire look and feel of a hacker’s PC using a [Rainmeter hacker theme](https://yash1331.deviantart.com/art/J-A-R-V-I-S-S-H-I-E-LD-OS-Yash1331-372105967).

![Hacker Theme Rainmeter](https://www.malwarefox.com//www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/hacker-theme-rainmeter.jpg)

Rainmeter is available for download free of cost.

## 9\. Give your Laptop the Personality that Shouts Hacker

![Hacker Laptop](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/laptop-2.png)

“What they will see, they will believe.” In simple words, you have to change the look of your laptop that screams hacker whenever your friends see it. Show your passion for hacking everywhere.

Purchase a laptop skin that is “hacker inspired” and select wallpapers that are mysterious and geeky to make your prank successful.

## 10\. Prank your Friends with Resource Hacker

Resource Hacker is a free tool that you can use to prank your friends. Download this free software and modify the values to tell your friends how you’ve decompiled this software and then recompiled it with your modifications.
