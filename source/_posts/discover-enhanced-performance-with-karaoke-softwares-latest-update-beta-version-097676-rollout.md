## Discover Enhanced Performance with Karaoke Software's Latest Update | Beta Version 0.9.7676 Rollout

[![karaoki-beta-0.9.7676](https://i1.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/karaoki-beta-0.9.7676.jpg?resize=845%2C321&ssl=1)](https://i1.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/karaoki-beta-0.9.7676.jpg?fit=1030%2C668&ssl=1 "karaoki-beta-0.9.7676")

**Karaoki public beta 0.9.7676 is available for download.**

Karaoki beta version 0.9.7676 can be downloaded and installed below. Version 0.9.7676 improves the new ‘singer scroll’ feature (news ticker addition that was added to the prior public beta) with a countdown timer, which kicks in and displays after a singer rotates (20 seconds after playback in the player). Development also took the proverbial boot to a few bugs and popped the hood to optimize the code – resulting in better overall performance.

**Here’s a quick rundown on how the new Auto-Karaoke Mode Countdown Timer works:**

* In-between singers Karaoki counts down to the next singer (as its always done), as the previous beta it now displays the time in minutes and seconds.
* When the timer reaches zero, the track starts and the standard “Next Singer……” message is displayed. It stays like this for the first 20 second of the track, then the singer is “Rotated” to the bottom of the rotation list.
* Then the countdown resumes with the next singer in the rotation. The countdown time is the tracks remaining time plus the auto karaoke singer “Gap” time.

Just like the prior public beta, you can now create/use multiple ticker messages, multiple screen 2 background images, change the color of the text based on the background image you’re using, and more.
