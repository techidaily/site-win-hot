## Exciting Update: Launch of Digitrax's Newest Karaoke Cloud Software!

[![Karaoke Cloud Pro Announcement Sony](https://i2.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/kcpannouncement-coverimage-1.jpg?resize=706%2C321&ssl=1)](https://i2.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/kcpannouncement-coverimage-1.jpg?fit=706%2C360&ssl=1 "Karaoke Cloud Pro Announcement - Sony")

**MESSAGE FROM THE CEO OF KARAOKE CLOUD PRO**

Dear Valued Karaoke Cloud Subscriber:

Please be advised that due to circumstances beyond our control, effective immediately DTE and Karaoke Cloud Pro will cease distribution of Sony/EMI-controlled works. We have removed Sony/EMI from the Karaoke Cloud content stream in order to comply with our licensing.

In the interim, we are lowering the price of the Karaoke Cloud subscription for your next pay period and going forward to $49.99 per month. As an added incentive, for those PCDJ faithful who maintain their Karaoke Cloud subscription throughout the service interruption, we will continue to honor the $49.99 price point for as long as you maintain your subscription, no matter how much content is added to Karaoke Cloud Pro in the future.

The interruption in service is due to the expiration of our licensing contract with Sony/EMI. We are negotiating with them to renew our license as quickly as possible, however, they are in the midst of multiple lawsuits against other karaoke labels (not DTE/Karaoke Cloud) in the USA and UK ([US case listed here](http://cdn.pacermonitor.com/pdfserver/GTD3O4A/51963941/SonyATV%5FMusic%5FPublishing%5FLLC%5Fet%5Fv%5F172902%5FOntario%5FInc%5Fet%5Fal%5F%5Ftnmdce-14-01929%5F%5F0337.1.pdf)– PDF), which is adding an unforeseen layer of complexity to the negotiations.

It is our sincere hope that we will have SATV/EMI content back in the Karaoke Cloud Pro stream as soon as possible. We are working diligently with all parties to accomplish this, so that the interruption in service will be minimal.

Sincerely,

Joe Vangieri  
Chief Executive Officer  
DigiTrax Entertainment/Karaoke Cloud Pro

The $49.99 per-month [Karaoke Cloud Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) subscription pricing will go in effect later today for all existing subscribers.
