With the release of the Digital 1200sl in 1998, the first [professional DJ software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) with headphone cuing (pre-fade listening), PCDJ paved the way for Digital DJ technology.

From the time when “no one would ever DJ with a computer” to “I need my DJ software to mix everything, minus my drinks”, PCDJ has been through the gauntlet, and continues to pioneer new live performance technology today. [DEX 3.11](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) is a testament to our commitment to innovation and providing DJs and Karaoke Hosts alike with the very best set of tools that make their jog easier and more enjoyable — which ultimately benefits their clients and fans.

[Mobile Beat](https://www.mobilebeat.com) sat down with yours truly a couple weeks ago to take a look back at our past — and how we’ve made to the present.
