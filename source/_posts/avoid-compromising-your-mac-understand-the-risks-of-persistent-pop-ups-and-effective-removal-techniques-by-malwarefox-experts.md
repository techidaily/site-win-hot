The scam works by displaying a pop-up message on the user’s screen, claiming the computer is infected with malware and urging the user to get rid of it immediately. 

The suggested solution provided by the pop-up message could be installing some sort of software or application. However, the recommended app or software is usually malicious and does more harm than good. 

This article describes in detail the “Pop-up (Mac) will damage your computer. You should move it to the trash” scam, including how it operates, how to avoid falling for it, and what to do if you have already been duped.
