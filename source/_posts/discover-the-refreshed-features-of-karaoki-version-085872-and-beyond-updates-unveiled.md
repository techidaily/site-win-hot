## Discover the Refreshed Features of Karaoki Version 0.8.5872 and Beyond – Updates Unveiled

[![New Karaoke Software Features Found in Version 0.8.5872](https://i1.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/karaoki-search-085872-coverimage.jpg?resize=530%2C298&ssl=1)](https://i1.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/karaoki-search-085872-coverimage.jpg?fit=530%2C298&ssl=1 "New Karaoke Software Features Karaoki")

For the past seven plus years it’s been Digtial 1 Audio’s collective goal to create the most user-friendly, robust professional **karaoke show hosting software** available. While we’re confident we have the best solution on the market today, we’re nowhere near satisfied.

[Karaoki](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) has received a **steady stream of free updates** since the first iteration dropped late 2007\. Many times, updates consist of small tweaks to existing features or merely maintenance releases to ensure **rock-solid stability**. We’ve also introduced major, game-changing functionality such as [SongbookDB](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) (_remote request system_) support, [Karaoke Cloud Pro subscription](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) integration and a much more in-depth “_fixed_” rotation mode.

**There has been one highly-requested, yet perceptually basic, change we hadn’t been able to work on — until now.** 

Karaoki (public beta) 0.8.5872 can be downloaded below and includes a new “_view mode_” for the library labeled “_search results._” When using this mode **search results populate the middle library pane**, allowing for the **singer rotation list to span the entire right side** library pane. If you’re managing a 30+ singer rotation, you’re really going to **enjoy the added work space!**

KJs can also **double-click the search box area for a larger search box** – another feature that Karaoki users have requested.

When hosting karaoke “_search_” is a karaoke hosts biggest assistant. The new “_search results_” view mode is surly a welcomed addition to one of karaoke software’s best assets.

#### Karaoki Build #0.8.5872.35193 Jan 2016

**Added, Changed Or Fixed:**  
• Enabled “Double Buffering” in list redraws.  
• Search Results can now be displayed in main case, when in this mode the rotation list incorporates the space previously occupied by the search results list.  
• “Rotation Data” notification popup moved to new location.  
• Updated Icon and Splash screen graphics  
• Save and Load BGM cases dialogue boxes to size increased.
