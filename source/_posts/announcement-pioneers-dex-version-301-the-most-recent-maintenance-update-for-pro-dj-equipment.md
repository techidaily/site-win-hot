## Announcement: Pioneer's DEX Version 3.0.1 - The Most Recent Maintenance Update for Pro DJ Equipment

[![](https://i1.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/dex301-coverimage1.jpg?resize=530%2C270&ssl=1)](https://i1.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/dex301-coverimage1.jpg?fit=530%2C298&ssl=1 "dex301-coverimage")

Our much anticipated [DEX 3 DJ mixing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) successfully launched 2 weeks ago, and now that the “_core foundation_” of the all-new platform is out our users can expect a flurry of updates including new features and ![dex301released](https://i2.wp.com/www.pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/dex301released.jpg?resize=416%2C234&ssl=1)tweaks monthly.

As with any new performance application once it’s in the hands of the public, with thousands of various configurations, machine specifications and [DJ controllers](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) — small maintenance patches are necessary to address any found issues, or to fine tune features for optimal performance on all platforms.

##### DEX 3.0.1 is now available for download. Here are the notable updates included in the maintenance release:

* Fixed slow searching bug (_for MAC users experiencing a lag while using search / it’s snappy now!_)
* Changed max favorite folders to 128 (_up from 32_)
* Added .divx extension support (files would play in previous release, but only if you changed file extension to .avi. No longer necessary)
* Various small bug fixes

##### Download the new free demo version of DEX 3 [HERE](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/)

##### For existing DEX 3 DJ software owners, download the patch [HERE](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) (will install directly over-top your existing version)
