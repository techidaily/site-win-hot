At times you might have noticed that your Chrome browser’s default search engine has been changed from google.com to search.yahoo.com without your permission. It usually happens when some web extension or application got hold of your browser’s settings.

In this guide, we would talk more about Yahoo Search and how to remove its unintentional redirection caused by [browser malware](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/).

## What is Search.yahoo.com?

Search.yahoo.com is the URL of the Yahoo’s search engine. Using search.yahoo.com does not bring any harm to your device. However, many users are unintentionally redirected to search.yahoo.com, while they are searching on Google.com. This redirection is carried out through the malware known as Browser Hijacker or Browser Virus.

## What is a Browser Hijacker?

A **Browser Hijacker,** commonly known as the [redirect Virus](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/),is a malicious program that gets an entry on your web browser through various means and infiltrates with browser settings, without user permission to promote the fake search engines or the affiliated web pages. Since users do not willingly install them, such hijackers are often considered as Potentially Unwanted Programs or Applications ([PUPs](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) or PUAs).

After entering your browser, a browser hijacker would get hold of its settings and change the default home page, search engine, and new tab redirection. All these would promote the dubious web page or search engine.

You might feel that browser hijackers are not much of a threat to your system, and there is no need to get scared of it. Unfortunately, that’s not true. Browser Hijackers itself might not be a significant threat, but when it enters your system, it can bring other more significant risks such as spyware, keyloggers, and other malware programs with it. These malicious software can cause extensive damage to you and your system. Also, the webpages it promotes cannot be trusted. They might be filled with illegitimate and malicious content. 

The browser hijacker might have altered your system settings, and that’s the reason search query is redirected to search.yahoo.com without your permission.

## How to remove the Yahoo search engine from Chrome?

To stop Yahoo searches from Chrome, you have to catch and remove the culprit browser hijacker, which is the root cause.

For that, follow these steps:

### **Step 1: Remove Yahoo using Settings**

1. Open the Chrome browser and go to **Settings.**![Open Settings in Chrome](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Open-Settings-in-Chrome.jpg)
2. From the left pane, select the **Search engine** option.![Chrome search engine settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chrome-search-engine-settings.png)
3. Choose the search engine of your choice from the drop-down list.![select search engine](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/select-search-engine.png)
4. Now, select the **Manage search engines** option.![manage search engines](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/manage-search-engines.png)
5. Click on the three dots next to Yahoo and choose **Remove from list**.![remove-yahoo](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/remove-yahoo.png)

### **Step 2: Restart your PC in Safe Mode**

Windows Safe Mode is the perfect environment to find out and solve the critical errors in the system. In safe mode, only system programs and some crucial programs run. Safe mode would most likely kill the applications and its files that try to run automatically on your system. [Follow this guide to boot your Windows 10 PC in the **Safe Mode**](https://www.windowschimp.com/how-to-boot-windows-10-into-safe-mode/)**.**

### **Step 3: Remove Web Extensions From Browser**

You might have accidentally installed a malicious browser web extension that is causing the redirects.

If you have many web extensions installed in your Chrome browser, it is time to sort them out and at least disable, if not delete, the ones you rarely use. However, you must remove the useless web extensions instead of disabling them. Because, even after disabling them, they might use the CPU processing power while checking for updates and performing updates.

Here are the steps to manage the web extensions on the Chrome Browser:

1. Click on the three dots at the top-right corner.
2. Bring mouse cursor over **More tools** and from the extended menu choose **Extensions**.![Extensions settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Extensions-settings.png)
3. All the extensions would be on your screen
4. Look for the ones you want to disable or remove.![manage chrome extensions](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/manage-chrome-extensions.jpg)

### **Step 4: Reset Web Browser Settings**

If your browser is misbehaving because of browser virus, then reset its settings to default.

1. Open Chrome and navigate to **Settings** by clicking on the three-dots at the top right.![Chrome Settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Chrome-Malware-Scanner-1.png)
2. Click on advanced **Advanced**.![Chrome Advanced Settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chrome-Malware-Scanner-2.png)

After recent updates in 2021 old windows user profiles came back to life wreaking havoc! Even a profile deleted intentionally due to it being compromised! Now my search options include yahoo, bing, ecosia, and Google. Then again based on the Google account ai am signed into those options change! The one thing that is consistent is that all my browsers now say that they’re managed by whom it is unclear these are personal cell phones tablets, laptops and desktops. My Yahoo account was legitimately hijacked in 2017 and was amongst the windows user that was intentionally deleted. How the heck did it come back to life? And how the heck do I get rid of it? The damage is intense and severe including OneDrive files now gone, TPMS having to be reset and corrupted Windows profiles being deleted.. I even had a Google account become a temp profile. You mentioned deleting the temp data however, with all the new updates the temp data is what roams across devices is it not? Wouldn’t deleting the temp data the roaming account?
