## Mastering DJ Software Design: The Art of Perfection Over Haste

[![](https://i0.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/neverrushart.jpg?resize=640%2C270&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/neverrushart.jpg?fit=640%2C400&ssl=1 "neverrushart")

  
**I‚Äôm a consumer, just like our PCDJ customers and everyone else on planet earth.** 

I buy a lot of tech specifically, most of it I really don‚Äôt need but much of the time I feel like I do ‚Äî after all, I‚Äôd hate to miss out on all the fun. I like to game a bit in my _‚Äúfree time‚Äù_ _(an XBOX One is now the entertainment epicenter of my family room)_, although I‚Äôd hardly consider myself a gamer. I have a younger brother who lives a thousand miles away in Baltimore and it gives us a great excuse to hang out and catch up _(and save the world, one zombie at a time!)_.

One game I was looking forward to purchasing and playing this summer was _**Dying Light**_ ‚Äì another one of many _‚Äúzombie genre‚Äù_ games, but one that promisingly mixes parkour gameplay with horror. An interesting spin on a popular genre. Recently, the makers of Dying Light made the following announcement:

> _‚ÄúAfter careful consideration, we have decided to release our upcoming game in February 2015,‚Äù Techland said when announcing the game‚Äôs delay, citing the game‚Äôs ‚ÄúNatural Movement‚Äù system as something they‚Äôd like to perfect._
> 
> _‚ÄúThe new date ensures that we can fully realize our vision of an innovative open-world game. We won‚Äôt need to make compromises or trade-offs on any of the five platforms we‚Äôre working on. For you, it means an outstanding, original game that makes the wait more than worthwhile.‚Äù_

  
Grrrrr. My kneejerk reaction was _‚ÄúWell, that sucks. How could a big time game studio get a release timeline that wrong?‚Äù_ 

_**I know better.**_  I‚Äôve been with PCDJ now for 15 years, and have worked with a few amazing and innovative developers over that span. One thing they have shared in common is a passion for programming, and DJing. They get to live their dream, combining both of the things they love best into a J O B. To them, creating [**professional DJ software**](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) is art; crafting a product with their minds eye, doing their best to match their lofty expectations.

**Set Your Deadlines, But Never Rush Art**

As many are already well aware, [PCDJ DEX 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) is close to launch. It‚Äôs going to be PCDJ‚Äôs most[![DEX 3 Screenshot 4-deck skin](https://pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/screenshot-video-sml-300x187.png)](https://pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/screenshot-video-sml.png) ambitious [**DJ software**](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) to date, and it‚Äôs largely a new application, built from the core foundation up. It‚Äôs been designed so that we can build features on top of the version 3 platform for the next 5-10 years. So even more so than in previous DEX 2 updates, testing and addressing issues are paramount.

We always set tentative release dates for any new PCDJ product launch. As a business, a lot of other items, such as marketing, depend on a (somewhat) accurate release date. There‚Äôs web info to update, box art to create, reviews by industry publications and DJ blogs etc. We do our absolutely best to hit our target launch date without delay.

However, if we‚Äôre in a beta test phase, as we are now with DEX 3, and our DJ beta testers are finding features that could use improvement ‚Äì or different ways to implement features that make sense and keep within our design goals ‚Äì we‚Äôll take the time to do it, and do it right. It‚Äôs more important that our DJ software meets our expectations, and yours, than speed to market.

For most DJs, DJ equipment and DJ mixing software help them to DJ better ‚Äì they depend on it not only for creative freedom while mixing, but to make a perfect impression on their clients. They want to create their artistry, without worry. We at PCDJ understand this, and as such our ‚Äúart‚Äù will never be rushed.

While DEX 3 will be launched soon publicly, this statement from the makers of Dying Light rings true for us:

> _‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt need to make compromises or trade-offs on any of the five platforms we‚Äôre working on. For you, it means an outstanding, original game that makes the wait more than worthwhile.‚Äù_

  
Replace ‚Äúgame‚Äù with ‚ÄúDJ software‚Äù. Now back to the batcave, _we‚Äôve got coding to do_.
