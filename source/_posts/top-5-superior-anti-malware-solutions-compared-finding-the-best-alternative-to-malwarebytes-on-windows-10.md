Along with the malware detection, it also provides browser extension which can block malicious websites on Chrome, Firefox and Edge. There are plenty of settings on the anti-ransomware, behavior blocker, web surfing and anti-phishing features.

Some user complained that Emsisoft Anti-Malware grabs a little more resources than usual. Emsisoft Protection Service uses an average of 300MB RAM even when idling in the background. This might be not an issue for an average issue considering high amount of RAMs these days.
