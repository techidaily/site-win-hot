## Go Back to You Download History

Majority of the time, lock screen ads are from the apps that you have downloaded. Logically, you will need to retrace your steps to determine which app is the culprit. However, this is complicated when you have downloaded a number of apps lately.

To do this, launch the Google Play Store application. Hit the hamburger menu on the upper left corner, right next to the search bar. On the menu, choose My apps & games.

![my apps & games](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1.jpg)

Choose the **Installed** tab. Then, change the order of the apps by hitting the sorting button that indicates **Alphabetical**.

On the pop-up menu, choose **Last Updated**. Try to remember when you first saw the lock screen ad, and you will have a general idea of which application causes it.

![last updated](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/3.jpg)

Uninstall the apps starting from the most recent. Check if the lock screen is still there after you uninstall each app.

![uninstall app](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/4.jpg)

Once you find the application which causes the ads, reinstall the other. Observe if they are causing lock screen ads as well. You may want to find an alternative application, so you do not have to deal with lock screen apps. Or you can change the app permission by following the steps in the next section.

## Examine App Permissions

If the method above did not resolve the issue, you might need to examine how your applications interact with your system. To do so, open your phone’s Settings. Then, hit Apps.

Go to your app list. Depending on your phone model, you may have to hit the triple-dot menu on the upper right corner. Then, select **Special access**. In other phones, you may have Special access right on the app list menu.

On the Special access menu, choose **Display over other apps**. This permission allows third-party applications to write over the interface of other apps and even the system. Some may use it to display advertisements.

## Install an Anti-Malware
