## About Norton Ghost

Norton Ghost is one **disk imaging and cloning tool** that firstly developed in the 1990s. It can help you make backup images of the whole hard disk, selected partitions or only those files that mean the most to you. When something goes wrong, Norton Ghost can [restore your computer to previous functional status](https://tools.techidaily.com/ubackup/products/). Besides, it can also help you clone one hard drive to another hard drive.

In a word, if you want to make an image back for your computer or want to clone to the new hard drive, Norton Ghost is not a bad choice. However, now Norton Ghost is **no longer available for the Home user**. It was **discontinued by Symantec in 2013**. Indeed you can still download the latest version - Norton Ghost 15, but it only offers a 30-day free trial and then you need to pay for it.
