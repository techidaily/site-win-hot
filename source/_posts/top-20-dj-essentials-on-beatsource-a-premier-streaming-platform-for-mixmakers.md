## Top 20 DJ Essentials on Beatsource: A Premier Streaming Platform for Mixmakers

[![Beatsource LINK with DEX 3 DJ Software](https://i2.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/addtolibraryheader.jpg?resize=797%2C321&ssl=1)](https://i2.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/addtolibraryheader.jpg?fit=797%2C490&ssl=1 "Beatsource LINK with DEX 3 DJ Software")

From time to time we like to cover some of the lesser known (at least for some subscribers) features of our integrated streaming services for DJs. Today we take a look at a benefit of being a [DEX 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) DJ that subscribes to [Beatsource LINK](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/).

Other than the obvious benefits of having access to millions of tracks through the DEX 3 browser for a low monthly fee, Beatsource LINK routinely posts procured playlists and each month posts the “Monthly Top 20” to [their website](https://news.beatsource.com/). It’s a compiled list of the tracks that DJs played the most the prior month with Beatsource LINK.

While it’s always nice to see what tracks are hot with other DJs in other markets, adding the Monthly Top 20 tracks to your own library in DEX 3 is a simple button click away.

At the bottom of each “Monthly Top 20” post you’ll find a button labeled “Save Playlist to your Library”. Click the button, fire up DEX 3 and automagically the Top 20 playlist will display under Beatsource LINK -> Playlists. Staying on top of what tunes are popping off right now with DJ crowdsourcing through Beatsource LINK couldn’t be easier.

For the month of February, 2021, Roddy Ricch continued to dominate with four songs on the chart, followed by Megan Thee Stallion with three.

Be sure to bookmark [Beatsource’s news page](https://news.beatsource.com/) so you can add the top 20 tracks to the [DEX 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) file browser each month!
