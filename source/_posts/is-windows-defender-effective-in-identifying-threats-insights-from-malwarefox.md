In the world of online security, there are a lot of myths and misconceptions floating around. One of the most common is the belief that Windows Defender, Microsoft’s built-in antivirus program, is not up to the task of detecting and removing malware.

Windows Defender is a program that is included with the Windows operating system. It is designed to help protect your computer from malware and other unwanted software.

While Defender may not be the most robust security program available, it is more than capable of protecting your computer from malware.

Let’s take a closer look at how Defender works and why you shouldn’t be afraid to rely on it to keep your PC safe.

## How does Microsoft Defender Work?

Contrary to popular belief, Windows Defender is actually a fairly sophisticated piece of software. It uses a combination of heuristics and signature-based detection to identify and remove malware. Heuristics allow Defender to detect brand-new malware that hasn’t been encountered before, while signatures help it to identify and remove known threats. 

In addition, Defender benefits from the fact that it is integrated into the Windows operating system; this gives it a level of access that other security programs can’t match.

All of this means that Defender is more than capable of detecting and removing malware from your computer. However, it’s important to remember that no security program is perfect. There are always going to be new threats appearing that haven’t been seen before, and sometimes these can slip past even the best security software. That’s why it’s important to have a backup plan in place, such as a good antivirus program.

## Features of Microsoft Defender

Microsoft Defender comes with a few features that can help you detect malware. These features include real-time protection, cloud-based protection, and behavioral detection. Real-time protection means that Defender will scan your computer for malware every time you access a file or program.

Cloud-based protection uses Microsoft’s cloud service to scan files for malware. Behavioral detection monitors your computer’s behavior for signs of infection. If the Defender finds any suspicious activity, it will take action to remove the malware.

Microsoft Defender can also help you remove malware that is already on your computer. To do this, you can run a full scan of your computer. A full scan will check all of the files on your computer for malware. If the Defender finds any malware, it will remove it from your computer. Other than the full scan, there are other scan options too.

You can also use Microsoft Defender to scan specific files or folders. To do this, right-click on the file or folder and select “**_Scan with Microsoft Defender_**.” The Defender will then scan the selected file or folder for malware.

## How is Defender Performing Compared to Other Antimalware?

In general, Defender is doing a good job of keeping people’s computers safe. In [recent independent av-tests](https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-windows/), it has been shown to be effective at detecting and removing malware. 

![defender av test result](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/defender-av-test-result.jpg)

However, it is not perfect, and there are some [types of malware that it is not very good at dealing with](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/).

There are other antimalware programs out there that can do a better job than Defender. Some of them are free, and some of them you have to pay for. If you are worried about your computer’s security, you may want to consider using one of these other programs.

However, the best way to protect your computer is to keep it up-to-date with the latest security patches and to be careful about the websites you visit and the files you download because even the best antimalware is not perfect.

However, in general, Defender is a good tool for keeping your computer safe from malware.

So, can Windows Defender detect malware? Yes, it most certainly can! Is it the most robust security program available? No, but it doesn’t need to be; for the majority of users, it provides more than enough protection.
