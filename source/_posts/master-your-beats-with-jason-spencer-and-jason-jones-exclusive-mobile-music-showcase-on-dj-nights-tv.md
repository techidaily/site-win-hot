##### Another great video for Mobile DJs from the guys at [Disc Jockey News](http://discjockeynews.com/) ala their Mobile Music segment with Jason Jones.

The Mobile Music segment features mobile DJs from around the country who are DJing weddings, schools and bars to find out how and what they play and when they play it. This week we feature [Jason Spencer of Spencer Weddings and Entertainment](http://spencerweddings.com/) in Sacramento California. He has been in the Mobile DJ business for 19 years.

Jason Jones is an MC/DJ, Performance Coach and speaker when he isn’t hosting shows on DJNTV. He is the co-founder of The Entertainment Experience, an experience design training company for wedding DJs, event planners and producers. He is also author of Bar DJ Secrets, a guide to delivering extraordinary value to bar owners while earning 2 to 3 times the market rate. He has performed in the DJ industry for over 24 years.

**In this video Jason Spencer discusses how he plays to the crowd, and what crowd queue’s to read to ensure you keep the dance floor packed and the night a memorable one.**
