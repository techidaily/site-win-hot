## Guide: Disabling Browser Trackers on Mozilla Firefox for Enhanced Privacy

The websites on the internet track your activity and create your profile so that they can serve you targeted ads. Firefox browser here comes as a savior. Now Firefox allows you to block the tracking content on the websites without using any third party add-ons.

## How Does Content Blocking Works on Firefox?

Firefox started blocking content to protect the privacy of users. Several websites collect user’s personal information like their interest, activity, likes, and dislikes, etc. This information is later used to serve targeted ads on your browser. They also sell it to other advertisement companies. Mozilla joined their hands with [Disconnect](https://disconnect.me/trackerprotection), a privacy concern company to start blocking such content. Disconnect classifies the trackers that collect information with the intent to use it later or share it with third-party clients. Such trackers are flagged and blocked. However, the trackers that collect information only to improve the user experience are allowed. Meaning when a tracker collects information and store it in a database, such trackers are blocked. Firefox has categorized the content blocking in three modes that let you choose according to your need.

* **Standard** – It is the default mode and only blocks the trackers that are harmful. It tries to create a balance for performance and protection. The Standard mode allows some trackers that are essential for the websites to function properly. It blocks the known trackers in the private window.
* **Strict** – This mode blocks all the trackers. It helps you to attain stronger security. However, some websites may not work correctly. It blocks known trackers, third-party tracking cookies, cryptominers, fingerprinters in all window.
* **Custom** – In this mode, you can choose what to block according to your need. You can select between trackers, cookies, cryptominers, and fingerprinters.

## How to Activate Content Blocking

Click on the **Firefox Menu** and choose **Content Blocking**. If you don’t see the option meaning you haven’t updated the Firefox. This option is available after the Firefox 65 update.![Block Trackers in Firefox 1](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Block-Trackers-in-Firefox-1.jpg)Now select a mode according to your need.![Block Trackers in Firefox 2](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Block-Trackers-in-Firefox-2.jpg)The **Standard** and **Strict** mode are pre-configured. However, the **Custom** mode allows you to configure the settings a little bit more. You can block the tracker in either private windows or all windows. Also, there is four option to select in case of blocking the cookies – third-party trackers, cookies from unvisited websites, all third-party cookies, and all cookies.![Block Trackers in Firefox 3](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Block-Trackers-in-Firefox-3.jpg)

### How to Know Firefox is Blocking Content

Now the content blocking on the Firefox is set. It will prevent the content as per the settings.
