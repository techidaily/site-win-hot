## Spotlight on SongBookDB's Enhanced DJ Collaboration Functionality

[![](https://i0.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/eventtimeline-shoutout.jpg?resize=530%2C298&ssl=1)](https://i0.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/eventtimeline-shoutout.jpg?fit=530%2C298&ssl=1 "eventtimeline-shoutout")

We launched our [**karaoke software** (Karaoki) integration with SongBookDB](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) a few weeks ago, a remote singer/song request platform that allows KJs to ditch printed karaoke song books in favor of an online solution.

The benefits are clear; you no longer need to print a new karaoke song book every time you update your music library — singers can browse, search a KJs music and make requests right from their phone via website or Android/iOS app — it’s unique and great sales tool for the KJ and venue — and a myriad of bonus features such as the ability to buzz a singers phone when their up to sing and **_“Shout Out”_**. This latter bonus feature is what we’re focusing on in this Feature Spotlight post.

#### Feature Spotlight: Shout Out

The _**“Shout Out”**_ feature included with your [SongBookDB subscription](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) allows you to simultaneously and instantly send a message to all singers browsing your karaoke song list via the SongBookDB Singers App ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.songbookdb.songbookdb&hl=en) /[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/songbookdb-karaoke-requests/id890913422?mt=8))

If you’re a KJ or Venue and want to inform the singers of the $1 fireball shots available for the next hour: **_Shout Out_**. If the karaoke host wants to let all crooners know when their next gig is and where: **_Shout Out_**. If the singer currently on the mic had a few too many of the $1 fireball shots and other singers look as though they’re ready to head for the nearest exit: _**Shout Out** (an apology)_.

You get the idea, and I’m sure you can come up with better uses for _**Shout Out**_ than I. _Learn More About SongBookDB [HERE](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/)_
