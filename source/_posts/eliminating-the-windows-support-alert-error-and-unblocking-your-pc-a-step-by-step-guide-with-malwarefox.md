## What is the “Windows Support Alert” virus alert?

“Windows Support Alert” is a fake virus alert that makes people believe that there is a virus or malware or their system. It would raise a phony warning that Windows has detected the unusual activities on your system, and to resolve that, you need to contact the given number. The number belongs to the cybercriminal behind the scam. Upon contact, he would manipulate the victims to steal their personal information, thus fulfilling their aim of identity theft. They would also ask for payment in the form of a one-time fee or subscription to a fake support service.

The dubious webpage displays the following message:

Windows Support Alert:

**** Microsoft Warning Alert** 
ERROR # 0xC004FC03

Please call us immediately at + 1-844-514-8111 (Microsoft Toll Free)
Do not ignore this critical alert.
If you close this page, your computer access will be disabled to prevent further 
damage to our network.
Your computer has alerted us that it has been infected with a Pornographic 
Spyware and virus. The following information is being stolen:

1. Facebook Logins
2. Credit Card Details
3. Email Account Logins
4. Photos and documents stored on this computer

Please call us within the next 5 minutes to prevent your computer from 
being disabled or from any information loss.

Apart from displaying this message, the scammers also download various files in the background, causing the browser to crash. This makes users believe that something is definitely wrong with their system.

It is essential to know that Microsoft has nothing to do with such scams. Their warning or error message never includes phone numbers, and they encourage their consumers to call them.

Moreover, Microsoft does not send emails or call you to get the personal and banking information to fix the system.

## Why Did I get the “Windows Support Alert” virus alert?

You have received the “Windows Support Alert” virus alert because your browser or system has been infected by a malicious program like browser hijacker or adware. It may have also appeared because you have visited an infected website.

Usually, a user does not deliberately visit the malicious sites and get infected with the malware; therefore they are often known as Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs)

When you install any bundled software, it carries another program other than the primary one. That other application can be a malware carrier responsible for phishing attacks.

## How to Fix “Windows Support Alert” virus alert?

If you are dealing with this message or pop-up repeatedly, you have to get rid of the root cause redirecting this fake message to you.

Here are the steps for that:

### **Step 1: Restart your PC in Safe Mode**

Windows Safe Mode is the perfect environment to find out and solve critical errors in the system. In safe mode, only system programs and some crucial programs run. Safe mode would most likely kill the applications and its files that try to run automatically on your system. [Follow this guide to boot your Windows 10 PC in the **Safe Mode**](https://www.windowschimp.com/how-to-boot-windows-10-into-safe-mode/)**.**

### **Step 2: Uninstall Suspicious Applications**

If the “Windows Support Alert” Scam still appears on your PC, try to find the culprit application and uninstall it.

![Open Task Manager](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Open-Task-Manger.png)

### **Step 3: Delete Temporary Files**

The temporary files folder can also be a carrier of malicious files. Thus, we recommend deleting all the temporary files and folders regularly for the smooth running of the system. Removing the temporary files would also clear the unnecessary clutter from your system and free up the valuable space.

Here are the steps to eliminate thre temporary files:

1. Open the Run command window.
2. Type **%temp%** and hit the enter key.![temp run command](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/temp-run-command.png)
3. This run command would navigate you to this path: **_C:\\Users\\\[username\]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp,_** that is, the temp folder.

## How to Avoid such Threats?

It is essential to avoid such threats so that you do not have to deal with them. Here are some tips for that:

1. Never fall into the trap of attractive pop-ups and banner ads.
2. Always ignore award-giving web pages and emails. Never click on the links they carry.
3. While installing software, uncheck the installation of the bonus program.
4. Avoid getting freeware programs from [unsecured and untrustworthy sources](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/).
5. Always keep installed a robust antimalware solution on your device so that any threat can be detected beforehand.

**1\. Is “Windows Support Alert” Scam by Microsoft?** 

NO. Microsoft is a trusted organization; that’s why scammers take advantage of its name to create fake warnings of “Windows Support Alert.”

**2\. What do I do when my computer is blocked by Microsoft?** 

Microsoft never blocks any computer. The reason you see the warning of “Microsoft has blocked your computer” is that a malware program has got an entry into your system and triggered the fake message to spread the spam.
