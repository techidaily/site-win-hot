**The [DEX 3.1 DJ Software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) update is now ready for download – a free update for all existing DEX 3 customers.**

This update focuses on strengthening many of the core features, and includes many performance improvements in addition to a few new features. The MAC version is now full 64bit compliant with improvements to the DJ controller engine. A couple of the more anticipated updates are to the browser, where you can now use “_List Mode_” for a more “_Excel_” style layout, versus the “Word” style used in previous versions. Songs will also not “grey out” when played during a session.

You will also receive new “_DayTime Skins_“, which are easier to see on daylight condition, and both skins have upgrades to the VU meters.

##### Here’s a list of all updates included in DEX 3.1:

**DEX 3.1 Version Updates:** 

* Extensive performance optimizations and stability improvements
* Added list-mode (table-like display mode) for current list/sidelist  
\* To change between normal and list-mode right-click on the list and select “Toggle view mode” from the popup menu  
\* You can: change columns order, hide/show columns, re-size columns, lock sorting or re-sizing, sort by clicking on the columns (and revert the sorting by clicking on the “No.” column header)
* Added daytime skins (and also modified master VU-meter color for the original skins)
* Added compatibility with iTunes 12
* Tags support greatly improved for both reading and writing (you can now edit tags for: mp3, m4a, mp4, wav, aif, flac, ogg, wma; note that most video files (except for mp4) don’t support tags so no tag editing is possible on mov, mkv, cdg-zip, au, etc)
* Changed functionality: you can also scroll the lists by dragging them from the right side (very useful for touch-screen users); drag-&-drop still works if you drag a track from the left side; (left 75% drag&drop / right 25% scroll)  
Improved controller engine on MacOSX
* Loaded tracks are “greyed out” (session only)
* Search improvements (includes fixing a search cache issue)
* For skins designers: jog-wheel artwork now possible (spinning or not, you can also use a mask for it)
* On Macs the app is now 64-bit (MacOSX 10.7+)
* **Known issues (to be addressed in next release):**  
On some AMD-powered graphics cards (AMD APU ones more specifically) the interface might not load ok
