## What is DJ Insurance?

[DJ Insurance](https://prosight.direct/pcdj) typically is a type of general liability insurance policy that is tailored to DJs. It is usually combined with Inland Marine coverage, which is what protects your DJ equipment. General liability insurance can help protect you from third-party claims of bodily injury and property damage. It can also assist with legal fees and defense costs related to a covered loss. Some insurance companies also provide equipment protection within their policies, while others may offer it as an additional option to purchase with your policy. Being that your job relies on your equipment, always check to make sure your policy includes equipment protection (inland marine coverage) prior to purchasing.

## Why Would I Want DJ Insurance?

**To Protect Your Equipment:** Running a DJ or Karaoke business can be costly. You have to maintain everything from an expensive laptop to mixers, karaoke software, controllers, and turntables. Only to run the risk of an intoxicated karaoke singer or party guest spilling their drink on your equipment. DJ Insurance can help cover the costs associated with repairing or replacing your damaged gear.

If you are a live performer playing an outdoor festival, you may be faced with some unforgiving weather that can ruin your speakers or other DJ gear. It can also cover equipment that is damaged in the car on the way to a performance, due to an accident.

Aside from damaged equipment, insurance for DJs can also assist with incidents involving theft. In a lot of cases, regular car insurance, homeowners’ insurance, or rental insurance won’t cover stolen DJ gear. However, DJ equipment insurance can reimburse you for the value of the gear that is not recovered if your DJ gear is stolen while at the venue you’re working at.

**To Protect Your Business:** As DJs and KJs, your livelihood is your DJ business. A DJ liability insurance policy can help cover claims related to the daily operations of your DJ services. For example, if a partygoer or karaoke participant were to trip on a loose wire while you were working at an event, you could be held liable and the victim of a lawsuit. DJ liability coverage could assist with the costs associated with the lawsuit, as well as provide you with a legal defense. Keep in mind, even if a lawsuit is frivolous it can still be costly.

Another example may be that a rowdy guest at a live event knocks over your speaker and causes damage to the venue where you are playing. There is a chance that you could be held liable for this if the venue seeks compensation to cover the cost of the repairs.

**The Venue Requires It:** When a hotel, event venue, bar, or party host hires a DJ, they typically ask for proof of liability coverage prior to agreeing to work with you. This is because, as mentioned above, there is always the risk that something could go awry. This is particularly true when there is both alcohol and lively attendees involved. Whether it’s an accident involving a guest or a technical issue, neither the DJ nor the venue wants to be held responsible.
