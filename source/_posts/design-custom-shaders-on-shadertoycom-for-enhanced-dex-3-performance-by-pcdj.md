## Design Custom Shaders on Shadertoy.com for Enhanced DEX 3 Performance by PCDJ

[![](https://i1.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/customshader-header.jpg?resize=706%2C321&ssl=1)](https://i1.wp.com/pcdj.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/customshader-header.jpg?fit=706%2C360&ssl=1 "Creating a Shader for use with DEX 3 video mixing software")

[Shader support](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/) was recently introduced into DEX 3, our [top DJ and video mixing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/), much to the delight of DJs that desire a method to display visualizations on screen when mixing audio tracks.

## So what is a ‘Shader’?

> From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader): _“In [computer graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer%5Fgraphics "Computer graphics"), a **shader** is a type of [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer%5Fprogram "Computer program") that was originally used for [shading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shading "Shading") (the production of appropriate levels of light, darkness, and color within an image) but which now performs a variety of specialized functions in various fields of computer graphics [special effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special%5Feffects "Special effects") or does [video post-processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video%5Fpost-processing "Video post-processing") unrelated to shading, or even functions unrelated to graphics at all.”_

**_Got that?_** 

While the description may seem fairly technical, creating shaders using the web-based [Shadertoy.com](http://www.shadertoy.com) website isn’t nearly as complicated as it may initially appear.

We found this easy-to-follow ‘[Beginner’s Guide to Coding Graphics Shaders](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-beginners-guide-to-coding-graphics-shaders--cms-23313)‘ for using the [Shadertoy.com](https://www.shadertoy.com/new) WebGL based platform to create custom shaders. The tutorial will help you learn the basics of coding shaders, which can be as simple as a bouncing ball or as in-depth as flying through a pulsating and ever-changing environment rich with color and texture.

## Why would I want to create a custom Shader?

Creating your own custom shader/s for use with DEX 3 is just another way to customize your DJ events, creating a more memorable and branded experience for your audience. It’s competitive out there, and with customer shaders you can help further your brand recognition and leave a lasting impression that will help you garner more interest in your services.

If you’re not interested in creating your own custom shaders, no worries, [we’ve compiled a list of shaders that work great in DEX 3 already](https://tools.techidaily.com/pcdj/products/)!
